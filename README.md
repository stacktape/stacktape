## 🎉 Now Open Source!

Stacktape is now open source after being a closed-source product for several years. We're excited to share our DevOps-free cloud development framework with the community!

## From scratch to production-grade AWS infra in a day. No DevOps knowledge required

- **Containers & Serverless**: Deploy both containers and Lambda functions
- **30+ AWS Resources**: SQL/NoSQL databases, load balancers, API gateways, Redis, MongoDB Atlas, and more
- **Risk-free**: extend, override or eject anytime
- **Infrastructure as Code**: TypeScript, YAML, or JSON. 97% shorter than writing it yourself.
- **Built-in CI/CD**: Supports both Push-to-deploy and Preview deploymnets.
- **Development Mode**: Run services locally while connected to cloud resources
- **Smart Builds**: Zero-config, optimized parallel builds with advanced caching
- **Security Built-in**: Secret management, least privilege permissions, private networking
- **Cost Optimization**: Detailed cost breakdown across all stacks and accounts
- **Easy Debugging**: Connect to running containers, access logs and metrics instantly
- **Production-grade**: Configured according to all of the AWS well-architected best practices

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install Stacktape globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g stacktape
```

Or use it directly with npx:

```bash
npx stacktape --version
```

### Create Your First Project

1. **Initialize a new project:**

```bash
stacktape init
```

2. **Configure your infrastructure** using TypeScript:

```typescript
import {
  defineConfig,
  LambdaFunction,
  HttpApiGateway,
  HttpApiIntegration,
  DynamoDbTable,
  StacktapeLambdaBuildpackPackaging
} from 'stacktape';

export default defineConfig(({ stage }) => {
  const database = new DynamoDbTable('myDatabase', {
    primaryKey: {
      partitionKey: { name: 'id', type: 'string' }
    }
  });

  const api = new HttpApiGateway('api', {
    cors: { enabled: true }
  });

  const myFunction = new LambdaFunction('myFunction', {
    packaging: new StacktapeLambdaBuildpackPackaging({
      entryfilePath: './src/index.ts'
    }),
    events: [
      new HttpApiIntegration({
        httpApiGatewayName: api.resourceName,
        method: 'GET',
        path: '/'
      })
    ],
    connectTo: [database],
    environment: {
      TABLE_NAME: database.name
    }
  });

  return {
    resources: { api, myFunction, database }
  };
});
```

3. **Deploy to AWS:**

```bash
stacktape deploy --stage dev --region us-east-1
```

That's it! Your app is now running on AWS. 🎉

## Configuration Options

Stacktape supports three configuration formats:

### TypeScript (Recommended)
```typescript
// stacktape.ts
import { defineConfig, LambdaFunction } from 'stacktape';

export default defineConfig(({ stage }) => ({
  resources: {
    // Your resources here
  }
}));
```

### YAML
```yaml
# stacktape.yml
resources:
  myFunction:
    type: function
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./src/index.ts
```

### JSON
```json
{
  "resources": {
    "myFunction": {
      "type": "function",
      "properties": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Supported Resources

- Multi-Container Workloads
- Batch Jobs
- Worker Services
- Edge Lambda Functions

**Databases:**
- PostgreSQL, MySQL (RDS)
- DynamoDB Tables
- MongoDB Atlas Clusters
- Redis Clusters (ElastiCache & Upstash)

**Networking:**
- HTTP API Gateway
- REST API Gateway
- Load Balancers
- Network Load Balancers

**Storage & CDN:**
- S3 Buckets
- Hosting Buckets (with CloudFront)

**Other:**
- User Auth Pools (Cognito)
- Event Bus (EventBridge)
- SQS Queues
- SNS Topics
- State Machines (Step Functions)
- Bastion Hosts (Jump Hosts)
- Web Application Firewall
- And more...

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

Run your services in development mode to iterate faster:

```bash
stacktape dev
```

This allows you to test changes without redeploying every time.

### Access Logs & Metrics

Logs and metrics are available in [stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com)

```bash
stacktape logs:tail --resource myFunction
```

### Run Scripts & Migrations

Define reusable scripts in your config:

```typescript
import { LocalScriptWithCommand } from 'stacktape';

export default defineConfig(() => ({
  scripts: {
    migrate: new LocalScriptWithCommand({
      executeCommand: 'npm run migrate',
      connectTo: [database],
      environment: { DATABASE_URL: database.connectionString }
    })
  }
}));
```

Run them with:

```bash
stacktape script:run --scriptName migrate
```

## Stacktape console

Stacktape offers a console that allows you to deploy and manage your stacks.

## Advanced Features

### Private Networking

Increase security by keeping services private:

```typescript
const privateService = new PrivateService('privateService', {
  // Configuration
});

const bastion = new Bastion('bastion', {
  // Use bastion to access private resources
});
```

### Override & Extend

Need more control? Override any AWS resource:

```typescript
const myFunction = new LambdaFunction('myFunction', {
  // ... standard config
  overrides: {
    lambda: {
      MemorySize: 4096,
      Timeout: 900
    },
    lambdaLogGroup: {
      RetentionInDays: 7
    }
  }
});
```

Or extend with raw CloudFormation or AWS CDK constructs.

## Pricing

If you don't want to use Stacktape console, you can use Stacktape core **completely free**. We're currently working on a build that doesn't require you to be logged in to Stacktape.

Paid versions of Stacktape include:

- CI/CD pipeline (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket)
- Web-based console for managing your stack
- Browse logs, metrics, costs and more
- Remote session to deployed containers
- Secrets management
- Guardrails and alarms
- Notifications
- Premium support **with 8 minutes average response time**

## VS Code Extension

If you want to use YAML-based configuration, we recommend installing [Stacktape editor extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stacktape.stacktape):

- ✅ Validation and error checking
- 💡 Intelligent autocompletion
- 📖 Inline documentation

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!

For QA, we use our own CI/CD pipeline which is not yet a part of this repository. For the time being, feel free to submit a PR, and we'll run it through our pipeline.
