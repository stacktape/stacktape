## How it works

### 1. Configure your stack

Stacktape is an **IaC** (Infrastructure as a code) tool.

The configuration is simple, declarative and can be written using **YAML**, **JSON**, **Javascript**, **Typescript** or **Python**.

> _Example **stacktape.yml** configuration file_

```yml
serviceName: my-application
resources:
  mainGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
  apiServer:
    type: container-workload
    properties:
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 2048
      scaling:
        minInstances: 1
        maxInstances: 5
      containers:
        - name: api-container
          imageConfig:
            filePath: src/main.ts
          environment:
            - name: DB_ENDPOINT
              value: $ResourceParam('mainDatabase', 'endpoint')
          events:
            - type: http-api-gateway
              properties:
                method: GET
                path: /{proxy+}
                containerPort: 3000
                httpApiGatewayName: mainGateway
  mainDatabase:
    type: relational-database
    properties:
      engine:
        type: aurora-postgresql-serverless
      credentials:
        masterUserName: $Secret('dbSecret.username')
        masterUserPassword: $Secret('dbSecret.password')
```

### 2. Deploy your application

Deployment is done using a **single command**.

Stacktape handles the rest:

- Packages your source code
- Scans and resolves dependencies
- Configures and provisions infrastructure resources
- Deploys your application to AWS

> \*Using **CLI\***

```bash
$ stacktape deploy --stage production --region eu-west-1
[SUCCESS] Loading configuration done in 0.03 sec.
[SUCCESS] Fetching stack data done in 0.63 sec.
[SUCCESS] Packaging workloads
 ↪ apiserver-apicontainer: done in 18.57 sec. Image size: 85 MB.
[SUCCESS] Uploading deployment artifacts done in 6.53 sec.
[SUCCESS] Validating template done in 0.42 sec.
[INFO] Deploying stack my-application-production...
[INFO] Deploying infrastructure resources. Finished: 9/35.
```

> \*Using **SDK\***

```js
import { Stacktape } from 'stacktape';
const stacktape = new Stacktape({
  region: 'eu-west-1',
  stage: 'production'
});
stacktape.deploy({
  config: {
    serviceName: 'my-application',
    resources: [...your resources...]
  }
});
```

### 3. Iterate on your application

Stacktape offers an easy and efficient way to develop your apps.

When developing containers, Stacktape will:

- Build and run your container locally with the same permissions it has when running in the cloud
- Resolve and inject referenced environment variables (for example database connection strings)
- Expose configured ports

```bash
$ stacktape cw:run-local --resourceName apiServer
[SUCCESS] Loading configuration done in 0.03 sec.
[SUCCESS] Fetching stack data done in 0.63 sec.
[SUCCESS] Packaging workloads
 ↪ apiServer-apicontainer: done in 3.3 sec. Image size: 85 MB.
[SUCCESS] Container started successfully. (type 'rs' + enter to rebuild and restart)
[INFO] Exposed ports: http://localhost:3000

Api container started successfully. Listening on PORT 3000.
```

## Comparison

### Serverless

<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Serverless framework is a great tool that simplifies deployment of function-based (FaaS) applications.

Sadly, the simplicity disappears when your application needs more than just functions, and you're left with the responsibility for configuring, managing and integrating other infrastructure components.

#### Stacktape's advantages

- **More power** - Besides lambda functions, Stacktape allows you to deploy container workloads, batch jobs, SQL and NoSQL databases, API Gateways, Load balancers and much more.
- **Optimized build process** - Stacktape supports zero-config, heavily optimized parallel builds with advanced caching.
- **Programmatic SDK** - Stacktape includes both CLI and SDK (currently supported for Javascript and Typescript). It allows you to easily build complicated deployment pipelines.
- **Better developer experience** - Stacktape is simple, well-documented and easily customizable. Everything is properly validated. Error messages are descriptive and include hints.
- **Editor extension** - Stacktape comes with a VS code editor extension to further improve developer experience with validation, autocompletion and built-in documentation.
- **Development studio (coming soon)** - Stacktape development studio is a graphical user interface. It's a convenient way to manage and test your applications and infrastructure.
- **Client SDKs (coming soon)** - Client SDKs (for web, mobile and more) can be used within your application to help with most common tasks (authenticating users, uploading files, etc.).

#### Stacktape's disadvantages

- **Not open-source** - Stacktape is a SaaS product. But it comes with a free tier.
- **Smaller community** - Being a new product, Stacktape doesn't have a large community yet.
- **AWS only** - Stacktape works on top of AWS. Support for MS Azure and Google Cloud is planned. Besides AWS services, Stacktape also supports 3rd party providers (such as MongoDb Atlas).
</details>

### Heroku

<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Heroku is an easy-to-use platform for hosting applications.

Sadly, it's also very costly and lacks a lot of features compared to larger cloud platforms (such as AWS).
