Upstash provides a serverless Redis service, which allows you to use the fast, in-memory NoSQL data store without having to manage your own servers. With its per-request pricing and low latency, Upstash is a great choice for serverless applications.

## Advantages

- **REST API:** You can access your database using a [simple REST API](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/features/restapi).
- **Secure:** You can enable TLS with a single click.
- **Highly available:** You can enable multi-zone replication to ensure that your data is always available.
- **Pay-per-request:** You only pay for what you use. See the [Upstash pricing](https://docs.upstash.com/redis/overall/pricing) for more details.
- **Scalable:** Upstash automatically scales to meet your needs.

## Disadvantages

- **Separate billing:** Although Stacktape integrates with Upstash, you will still need to manage your billing separately.
