An SNS topic provides high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. It's a managed service that allows you to send messages to a large number of subscribers, including distributed systems, microservices, and serverless applications. You can use SNS for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication.

Under the hood, Stacktape uses [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).

# When to use them

Stacktape offers three managed resources for messaging and communication:

1.  SNS topics
2.  [SQS queues](/other-resources/sqs-queues/)
3.  [Event buses](/other-resources/event-buses/)

**Use an SNS topic when:**

-   You need to publish messages to many different subscribers with a single action.
-   You require high throughput and reliability.

**Use an SQS queue when:**

-   You need reliable, one-to-one, asynchronous communication to decouple your applications.
-   You want to control the rate at which messages are consumed.

**Use an event bus when:**

-   You want to publish messages to many subscribers and use the event data itself to filter which messages are delivered to which subscribers.
-   You need to integrate with third-party SaaS providers like Shopify, Datadog, or PagerDuty.

# Basic usage

You don't need to specify any properties to create a basic SNS topic.

`embed:sns-topics/basic.stp.yml`

<PropertiesTable definitionName="SnsTopic" />

# Integrating with workloads

You can trigger a [function](/compute-resources/functions/#sns-event) or a [batch job](/compute-resources/batch-jobs/#sns-event) whenever a message is published to an SNS topic.

`embed:lambda-functions/event-sns.stp.yml`

# Publishing messages

You can use the [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/#SDKs) to publish messages to a topic.

```javascript
import { PublishCommand, SNSClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-sns";

const snsClient = new SNSClient({});

snsClient.send(
  new PublishCommand({
    Message: "Hello from the other side.",
    TopicArn: process.env.STP_MY_TOPIC_ARN,
  })
);
```

# FIFO

You can enable FIFO (First-In, First-Out) to ensure that messages are processed in the exact order that they are sent.

<PropDescription definitionName="SnsTopicProps" propertyName="fifoEnabled" descType="ld" />

`embed:sns-topics/fifo.stp.yml`

## Content-based deduplication

You can enable content-based deduplication to prevent duplicate messages from being sent.

<PropDescription definitionName="SnsTopicProps" propertyName="contentBasedDeduplication" descType="ld" />
