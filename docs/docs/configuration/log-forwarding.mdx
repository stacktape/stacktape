Log forwarding is the process of sending log data from your applications and services to a centralized location or a third-party log management provider. While _CloudWatch_ is the primary log management service in AWS, many users choose to forward logs to third-party providers for advanced features like real-time analysis, machine learning insights, and customizable dashboards, or to meet specific compliance requirements.

Stacktape makes it easy to forward logs to the endpoint of your choice.

## HTTP endpoint forwarding

You can forward logs to any HTTP endpoint that complies with the [Firehose request and response specifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/httpdeliveryrequestresponse.html). Many third-party vendors are compliant with these specifications out of the box.
