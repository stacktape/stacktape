You can deploy your application to AWS from your local machine using the Stacktape command-line interface (CLI).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

-   A **Stacktape account**.
-   An **AWS account** connected to your Stacktape organization.

You can create both of these in the [Stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/).

## 1. Install and Log In

First, install the Stacktape CLI:

<CodeBlock
  tabs={[
    { lang: "bash", code: "iwr https://installs.stacktape.com/windows.ps1 -useb | iex\n", label: "Windows (PowerShell)" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | sh\n", label: "Linux" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos.sh | sh\n", label: "macOS" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos-arm.sh | sh\n", label: "macOS (ARM)" }
  ]}
/>

After installation, you may need to add the Stacktape `bin` folder to your `PATH` environment variable. The installation script will provide instructions if this is necessary.

Next, log in to your Stacktape account:

```bash
stacktape login
```

This command will prompt you for your Stacktape API key, which you can find on the [API keys page](https://console.stacktape.com/api-keys/) in the console.

## 2. Configure Your Stack

Create a configuration file named `stacktape.yml` or `stacktape.ts` in the root of your project. This file defines your application's infrastructure and services.

If you don't have a configuration file yet, you can:

-   Use the [interactive config editor](https://console.stacktape.com/template-editor) to generate one.
-   Start with a [starter project](/getting-started/starter-project) that includes a pre-configured file.
-   Follow a tutorial like the [Fullstack Next.js T3 app](/tutorials/t3-nextjs-app) or [Web API](/tutorials/web-api).

## 3. Deploy

Once you have your configuration file, you can deploy your stack with a single command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --projectName <project-name> --stage <stage-name> --region <aws-region>
```

-   `--projectName`: A unique name for your project (e.g., `my-awesome-app`).
-   `--stage`: The name of the environment you're deploying to (e.g., `production`, `staging`).
-   `--region`: The _AWS region_ to deploy to (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`).

Stacktape will stream the deployment logs to your terminal. Once the deployment is complete, you can view your stack's details in the Stacktape console.
