## Overview

- SDK offers a programmatic way of interacting with the Stacktape API.
- Unlike other Infastructure as Code tools such as AWS CDK or Pulumi, it offers a truly dynamic way of interacting with
  your stacks (as opposed to just programmatically creating the configuration).
- Behind the scenes, Stacktape SDK interacts with a GRPC server that executes Stacktape commands in a separate process.
- Currently, the SDK is available only for Javascript/Typescript. Python, Go and Java SDKs will be available soon.
- Stacktape SDK is fully typed and includes a built-in documentation for every property.
