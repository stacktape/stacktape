# Overview and basic usage

<br />

### stack:info

Prints information about a specified stack.

You can get information in two formats:

- **Simple (default):** Prints helpful links and parameters for the deployed stack to the terminal.
- **Detailed (`--detailed` flag):** Saves detailed information about the stack to a file (default: `stack-info.yaml`).
  You can customize the output file and format with the `--outFile` and `--outFormat` options.

In **detailed** mode:

- If the stack is deployed, you'll get an overview of the deployed resources.
- If you also provide a configuration file, the output will show a diff between the deployed resources and the
  configuration, indicating which resources will be created, updated, or deleted on the next deployment.
- If the stack is not deployed, it will show an overview of the resources that will be created.

By default, sensitive values are omitted. To include them, use the `--showSensitiveValues` flag.
