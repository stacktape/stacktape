# Overview and basic usage

<br />

### deploy

Deploys your stack to AWS.

If the stack doesn't exist, it creates a new one. If it already exists, it updates it. This command requires a valid
Stacktape configuration file (`stacktape.yml`) in the current directory, or you can specify a path using the
`--configPath` option.

const stacktape = new Stacktape();

stacktape.deploy({
  region: "<<region>>",
  stage: "<<stage>>"
});
