## Installing Stacktape

### Using an installation script

<CodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: "iwr https://installs.stacktape.com/windows.ps1 -useb | iex\n",
      label: "Windows (PowerShell)"
    },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | sh\n", label: "Linux" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos.sh | sh\n", label: "macOS" },
    { lang: "bash", code: "curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos-arm.sh | sh\n", label: "macOS (ARM)" }
  ]}
/>

After the installation is complete, you may need to manually add the Stacktape bin folder to your `PATH` environment variable. To do so, follow the instructions printed in the terminal.

### Manual installation

To install Stacktape manually, download the appropriate binary from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/stacktape/stacktape/releases).

Extract the archive to `~/.stacktape/bin` and add this directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

## Installing a specific version

To install a specific version, set the `STACKTAPE_VERSION` environment variable before running the installation script.

<CodeBlock
  tabs={[
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: '$env:STACKTAPE_VERSION="2.0.0" && iwr https://installs.stacktape.com/windows.ps1 -useb | iex\n',
      label: "Windows (PowerShell)"
    },
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: 'export STACKTAPE_VERSION="2.0.0" && curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/linux.sh | sh\n',
      label: "Linux"
    },
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: 'export STACKTAPE_VERSION="2.0.0" && curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos.sh | sh\n',
      label: "macOS"
    },
    {
      lang: "bash",
      code: 'export STACKTAPE_VERSION="2.0.0" && curl -L https://installs.stacktape.com/macos-arm.sh | sh\n',
      label: "macOS (ARM)"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Semantic versioning

Stacktape follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) as closely as possible.

There may be minor breaking changes in minor versions from time to time, but these are always documented on the [releases page](https://github.com/stacktape/stacktape/releases).
