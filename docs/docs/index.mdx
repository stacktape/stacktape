## Welcome to Stacktape

**Deploy production-grade applications to your own AWS account in minutes, not months.**

Stacktape is a deployment platform that combines the power and flexibility of AWS with a radically simplified developer experience. It handles the complexity of cloud infrastructure, so you can focus on what matters most: building your product.

With Stacktape, you can:

-   **Ship faster:** Go from source code to a production-ready deployment in a single day.
-   **Save money:** Avoid expensive PaaS solutions and over-provisioned infrastructure.
-   **Stay in control:** Deploy to your own AWS account with no vendor lock-in. You can extend, override, or eject at any time.
-   **Deploy anything:** From simple web services to complex, multi-service applications.
