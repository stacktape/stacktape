Secrets allow you to securely store and manage credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information required by your applications. Secrets are stored in your AWS account using [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

# Managing secrets

You can store secrets as either simple strings (e.g., `mypassword`) or as JSON objects (e.g., `{ "username": "my-username", "password": "my-password" }`). Secret names can be up to 512 characters long, and values can be up to 65,536 bytes.

Stacktape provides CLI commands for managing your secrets:

## Creating and updating a secret

Use the [`secret:create`](/cli/commands/secret-create) command to create or update a secret.

```bash
stacktape secret:create --region my-region
```

You will be prompted to enter the required values. If a secret with the same name already exists, you will be asked if you want to update it.

## Deleting a secret

Use the [`secret:delete`](/cli/commands/secret-delete) command to delete a secret.

```bash
stacktape secret:delete --region my-region
```

## Getting a secret value

Use the [`secret:get`](/cli/commands/secret-get) command to retrieve the value of a secret.

```bash
stacktape secret:get --region my-region
```

# Referencing secrets

You can reference secrets in your configuration using the [`$Secret()` directive](/configuration/directives/#secret).

`embed:user-guide/secrets/referencing.stp.yml`

<Warning>

If you update a secret, any stacks that are already deployed will continue to use the old version. To use the new version, you must redeploy the stack.

</Warning>

# Pricing

You are charged $0.40 per secret per month.
