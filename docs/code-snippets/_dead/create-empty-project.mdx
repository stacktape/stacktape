## 1 - Create Stacktape project

First, create a Stacktape project.

In the [Stacktape console](https://console.stacktape.com/) click on the `Deploy new project` button in the top right
corner and choose `Any project using CLI`.

1. **Choose project name** - project name can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. The name is arbitrary, but
   developers often use the name of the Bitbucket repository as their project name. In this tutorial, we are using
   `my-project-1`.
2. **Choose how you write a configuration** - If you already have our Stacktape configuration prepared in our Bitbucket
   repository, choose `I'll write Stacktape config on my own`. In our case, we will create the Stacktape configuration
   now, so we choose `Interactively in console` - this option provides an interactive editor to write your Stacktape
   configuration in the next step.

If you have chosen to write configuration `Interactively in console`, then in this step, you will write Stacktape config
using the interactive config editor. Our configuration only contains an HTTP API gateway connected to a Lambda function.
After finishing with the configuration, continue to the next step.

Your Stacktape project is created and ready to be used. In the final step, you can see information on how to install
Stacktape CLI and log in to Stacktape on your local machine.

If you have used an interactive configuration editor to create your configuration, you can use `stacktape init` command
to download the created configuration onto your local machine. You should place the downloaded file in the root of your
project repository.
