# 0. In this tutorial

You will create a statically-built website using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).

<br />

- The statically built code for the website will be hosted in a [storage bucket](/resources/buckets/).
- To improve load times, the bucket will use a [CDN](/resources/cdns/) (Content delivery network).

<br />

The infrastructure required for this application uses exclusively "serverless", pay-per-use infrastructure. If your load
won't get high, the costs will be close to 0. You can also control your cloud spend using
[budget control](/configuration/budget-control/).

# 1. Configure your stack

Start with an empty project directory. Call it whatever you like.

<br />

To deploy your application, you need to configure your **"stack"**. The stack consists of an application code and the
infrastructure required to run it. You can deploy your stack to multiple environments (stages) - for example
`production`, `staging` or `testing`.

## 1.1 Add a configuration file

To configure the stack, Stacktape requires you to write a simple configuration.

Start by creating a file called `stacktape.yml` in the root directory of your project. In this tutorial, you will use
**YAML** to write your configuration, but Stacktape supports more options (JSON, Javascript and Typescript).

<Info>
  If you're using vscode, you can install <b>Stacktape</b> extension. It automatically validates your configuration
  file, provides documentation (when you hover over properties), autocompletion, suggestions and useful links.

## 1.2 Configure service name

You can choose an arbitrary name, for example `gatsby-static-web`.

```yml

```

## 1.3 Create infrastructure resources
