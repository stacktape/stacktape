# Advantages

- **Performance:** As an in-memory data store, Redis can deliver sub-millisecond response times, making it an order of magnitude faster than disk-based databases.
- **Fully managed:** Stacktape handles all the operational overhead, including scaling, provisioning, patching, and backups.
- **High availability:** Supports both clustered and non-clustered modes and provides automatic failover with minimal impact.
