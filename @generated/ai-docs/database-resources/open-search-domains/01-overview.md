# Overview

OpenSearch is a scalable, open-source search and analytics suite. It's used for various purposes, including full-text search, log analytics, and real-time application monitoring. As a fully managed service, Stacktape makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale OpenSearch clusters in the AWS Cloud.

Under the hood, Stacktape uses [AWS OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/), which was previously known as Amazon Elasticsearch Service.
