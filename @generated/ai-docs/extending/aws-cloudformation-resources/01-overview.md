# Overview

You can use the `cloudformationResources` section of your `stacktape.yml` file to extend your Stacktape template with native _Cloudformation_ resources. This allows you to configure, manage, and interconnect _Cloudformation_ resources with other resources in your stack, giving you the full power of AWS in a single configuration file.
