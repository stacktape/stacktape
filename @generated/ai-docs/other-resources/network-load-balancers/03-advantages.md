# Advantages

- **Predictable pricing:** NLBs have a predictable pricing model, which can be more cost-effective than HTTP API Gateways for high-traffic applications.
- **Scalability:** NLBs can handle millions of requests per second and scale automatically as traffic grows.
- **Health checks:** When used with container workloads, an NLB periodically checks the health of each container and only routes traffic to healthy ones.
- **Ease of use:** You can integrate an NLB with your compute resources with just a few lines of configuration.
- **Security:** You can offload SSL/TLS termination to the load balancer, encrypting traffic between the client and the NLB.
