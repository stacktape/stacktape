# Overview

An event bus allows you to build scalable, event-driven applications. It's a serverless service that automatically scales based on the number of events ingested, and you only pay for the events you publish. Events can be published from your own applications or from third-party SaaS applications.

Under the hood, Stacktape uses [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/).
