# Overview

An SNS topic provides high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. It's a managed service that allows you to send messages to a large number of subscribers, including distributed systems, microservices, and serverless applications. You can use SNS for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication.

Under the hood, Stacktape uses [Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).
