# Cache control

You can control the caching behavior of the _CDN_ in two ways:

1.  **Using the `Cache-Control` header (recommended):** This gives you fine-grained control over the caching behavior for each response from your origin.
2.  **Using CDN caching options:** This allows you to set basic caching rules but is less flexible.
