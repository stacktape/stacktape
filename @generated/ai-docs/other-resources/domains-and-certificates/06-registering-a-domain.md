# Registering a domain

You can register a new domain in the [AWS Route 53 console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/route53/domains/home?region=eu-west-1#/DomainSearch). Once your domain is registered, you can follow the steps in [Managing domains with Stacktape](./02-managing-domains-with-stacktape.md).
