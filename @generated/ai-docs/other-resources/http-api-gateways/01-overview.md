# Overview

An HTTP API Gateway serves as an entry point for your application, routing HTTP traffic to your compute resources. It can be integrated with [functions](../../compute-resources/functions//index.md), [batch jobs](../../compute-resources/batch-jobs//index.md), and [multi-container workloads](../../compute-resources/multi-container-workloads//index.md).

Each API gateway is secured with TLS by default. You can also configure a custom domain name, enable CORS, or place a _CDN_ in front of your gateway.
