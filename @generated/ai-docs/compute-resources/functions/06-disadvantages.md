# Disadvantages

-   **Limited execution time**: A function can run for a maximum of 15 minutes.
-   **Limited configuration**: You can only configure memory (from 128MB to 10GB), and CPU power scales proportionally.
-   **More expensive for certain tasks**: For continuous or predictable workloads, batch jobs or container workloads can be more cost-effective.
-   **_Cold starts_**: The first invocation of a function after a period of inactivity can experience a slight delay.
