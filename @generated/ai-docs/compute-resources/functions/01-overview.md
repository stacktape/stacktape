# Overview

Functions are Stacktape's abstraction for AWS Lambda, a _serverless_ compute service that lets you run code without managing servers. You can write code in multiple languages and trigger it to run in response to events like HTTP requests, file uploads to an _S3 bucket_, or messages in an SQS queue.

This allows you to build and deploy web applications, process data, and automate workflows while only paying for the compute time you use.
