# Image

A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. You can provide an image in four ways:

-   Images built using [stacktape-image-buildpack](../../../configuration/packaging.md)
-   Images built using [external-buildpack](../../../configuration/packaging.md)
-   Images built from a [custom-dockerfile](../../../configuration/packaging.md)
-   [prebuilt-images](../../../configuration/packaging.md)
