# Pricing

You are charged for:

-   The compute instances running your batch jobs.
-   A negligible amount for the Lambda functions and Step Functions that manage the job's execution.

Pricing depends on the instance type and region. You can significantly reduce costs (by up to 90%) by using [_spot instances_](./13-spot-instances.md).
