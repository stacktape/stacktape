# Logging

Any output to `stdout` or `stderr` is captured and stored in a CloudWatch log group. You can view logs through the [Stacktape Console](https://console.stacktape.com/), the `stacktape stack-info` command, or by streaming them with the `stacktape logs` command.

### Forwarding logs

You can forward logs to third-party services. See the [Log Forwarding documentation](../../../configuration/log-forwarding.md) for more details.
