# Storage

Each service instance has its own temporary, or _ephemeral storage_, with a fixed size of 20GB. This storage is deleted when the instance is removed. Different instances of the same service do not share their storage.

For persistent data storage, use [Buckets](../../other-resources/buckets/index.md).
