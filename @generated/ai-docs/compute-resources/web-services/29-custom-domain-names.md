# Custom domain names

You can use a custom domain for your web service. If you don't have one, you can [register one](../../other-resources/domains-and-certificates//index.md) through Stacktape.

If you already have a domain, you can either let [Stacktape manage it](./30-using-stacktape-to-manage-domains-and-certs.md) (if you use AWS Route 53 for DNS) or [use a third-party DNS provider](./31-using-a-3rd-party-dns.md).

For more details, see the [Domains and Certificates](../../other-resources/domains-and-certificates//index.md) page.
