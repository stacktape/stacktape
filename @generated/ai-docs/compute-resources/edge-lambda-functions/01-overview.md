# Overview

An Edge Lambda Function is a compute resource that runs your code at _CDN_ edge locations, bringing it closer to your users to reduce latency and improve performance. These functions are globally distributed, ensuring that requests are handled by the nearest location.

Edge Lambdas are _serverless_, which means Stacktape manages the infrastructure, security, and scaling for you. They support Node.js and Python runtimes and follow a **pay-per-use** model, so you only pay for the execution time you consume.

Common use cases include user authentication, request validation, and cookie manipulation.
