# Pricing

Amazon Cognito has a free tier for user pools, which includes 10,000 monthly active users (MAUs) for users who sign in directly or through a social identity provider. For users who sign in through SAML or OIDC federation, the free tier includes 50 MAUs.

Beyond the free tier, pricing is based on the number of MAUs. For the "Lite" tier, the costs are as follows:

-   **10,001 - 100,000 MAUs:** $0.0055 per MAU
-   **100,001 - 1,000,000 MAUs:** $0.0046 per MAU
-   **Over 1,000,000 MAUs:** $0.00325 per MAU

For users federated through SAML or OIDC, the price is $0.015 per MAU above the free tier.

Additional charges apply for sending SMS messages for MFA and for using advanced security features. For detailed and up-to-date pricing information, see the [Amazon Cognito pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/pricing/).
