# Creating and updating a secret

Use the [`secret:create`](../../cli/commands/secret-create.md) command to create or update a secret.

```bash
stacktape secret:create --region my-region
```

You will be prompted to enter the required values. If a secret with the same name already exists, you will be asked if you want to update it.
