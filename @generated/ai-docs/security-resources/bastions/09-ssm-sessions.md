# SSM sessions

Stacktape uses [SSM Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) to provide secure access to bastion servers. This eliminates the need to manage SSH keys or open additional network ports, making it more secure than traditional SSH access.
