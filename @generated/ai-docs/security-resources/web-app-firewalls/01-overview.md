# Overview

A web application firewall (WAF) protects your internet-facing applications from common web exploits that could affect their availability, compromise their security, or consume excessive resources. It works by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic based on a set of rules.

You can use a WAF to:

-   Block malicious traffic using managed rule groups that are curated by security experts.
-   Create your own custom rules to address specific threats.
-   Implement rate-based rules to prevent your resources from being overloaded by excessive requests.

You can use a WAF with the following Stacktape resources:

-   [Web Services](../../compute-resources/web-services//index.md)
-   [User Pools](../../security-resources/user-auth-pools//index.md)
-   [Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)](../../other-resources/cdns//index.md)
