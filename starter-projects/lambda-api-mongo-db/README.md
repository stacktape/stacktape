# Lambda API with MongoDb

- This project deploys a simple Lambda-based HTTP API.
- The application runs in a [Lambda function](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/lambda-functions/) and uses
  [MongoDb Atlas cluster](https://docs.stacktape.com/3rd-party-resources/mongo-db-atlas-clusters/) to store the data. To
  simplify the database access, this project uses [Mongoose ORM](https://mongoosejs.com/).
- This project includes a pre-configured [stacktape.yml configuration](stacktape.yml).
  The configured infrastructure is described in the [stack description section](#stack-description)

## Pricing

- Fixed price resources:

  - **MongoDb Atlas cluster** ($0.012/hour, ~$9/month)

- There are also other resources that might incur costs (with pay-per-use pricing). If your load won't get high, these costs will be close to $0.

4. **MongoDb Atlas account**. To create one, refer to our [step-by-step guide](https://docs.stacktape.com/user-guides/mongo-db-atlas-credentials/).

## 1. Generate your project

To initialize the project, use

```bash
stacktape init --projectId lambda-api-mongo-db
```

To deploy your application inside [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) pipeline, also use the `--deployFrom codebuild` flag.

To deploy your application inside [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) pipeline, also use the `--deployFrom github` flag.

To deploy your application inside [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) pipeline, also use the `--deployFrom gitlab` flag.

## 2. Before deploy

- Fill in your MongoDb Atlas credentials in the `providerConfig.mongoDbAtlas` section of the stacktape.yml config file. To learn how to get your API keys and organization ID, refer to [MongoDB Atlas tutorial](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/#std-label-atlas-prog-api-key).

## 3. Deploy your stack

The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

<details>
<summary>Deploy from local machine</summary>

<br />

The deployment from local machine will build and deploy the application from your system. This means you also need to have:

- Docker. To install Docker on your system, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).- Node.js installed.

<br />

To perform the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

## 4. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the terminal (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

To test the application, you will need the web service URL. It's printed to the terminal.

### Create a post

Make a `POST` request to `<<web_service_url>>/post` with the JSON data in its body to save the post. Use your preferred HTTP client or
the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -X POST <<web_service_url>>/posts -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ "title": "MyPost", "content": "Hello!", "authorEmail": "info@stacktape.com"}'
```

If the above cURL command did not work, try escaping the JSON content:

```bash
curl -X POST <<web_service_url>>/posts -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ \"title\":\"MyPost\",\"content\":\"Hello!\",\"authorEmail\":\"info@stacktape.com\"}'
```

### Get all posts

Make a `GET` request to `<<web_service_url>>/posts` to get all posts.

```bash
curl <<web_service_url>>/posts
```

## 5. Run the application in development mode

To run functions in the development mode (remotely on AWS), you can use the
[dev command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/dev/). For example, to develop and debug lambda function `savePost`, you can use

```bash
stacktape dev --region <<your-region>> --stage <<stage>> --resourceName savePost
```

The command will:

- quickly re-build and re-deploy your new function code
- watch for the function logs and pretty-print them to the terminal

The function is rebuilt and redeployed, when you either:

- type `rs + enter` to the terminal
- use the `--watch` option and one of your source code files changes

## 6. Hotswap deploys

- Stacktape deployments use [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.

- To speed up the deployment, you can use the `--hotSwap` flag that avoids Cloudformation.
- Hotswap deployments work only for source code changes (for lambda function, containers and batch jobs) and for content uploads to buckets.
- If the update deployment is not hot-swappable, Stacktape will automatically fall back to using a Cloudformation deployment.

```bash
stacktape deploy --hotSwap --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

## 7. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stacktape delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
pipeline and other aspects of your stacks.

You can deploy your services to multiple environments (stages) - for
example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`. A stack is a running instance of a service. It consists of your application
code (if any) and the infrastructure resources required to run it.

The configuration for this service is described below.

## 1. Service name

You can choose an arbitrary name for your service. The name of the stack will be constructed as
`{service-name}-{stage}`.

```yml
serviceName: lambda-api-mongo-db
```

## 2. Resources

- Every resource must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
- Stacktape resources consist of multiple (sometimes more than 15) underlying AWS or 3rd party resources.

### 2.1 HTTP API Gateway

API Gateway receives requests and routes them to the container.

For convenience, it has [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) allowed.

```yml
resources:
  mainApiGateway:
    type: http-api-gateway
    properties:
      cors:
        enabled: true
```

### 2.2 MongoDB Atlas cluster

The application data is stored in an Atlas MongoDB cluster.

Only the cluster tier needs to be configured in a minimal setup. You can also configure
[other properties](https://docs.stacktape.com/3rd-party-resources/mongo-db-atlas-clusters/) if desired.

```yml
mongoDbCluster:
  type: mongo-db-atlas-cluster
  properties:
    clusterTier: M2
```

### 2.3 Functions

The core of our application consists of two serverless functions:

- **savePost function** - saves post into database(MongoDB)
- **getPosts function** - get all posts from the database(MongoDB)

Functions are configured as follows:

- **Packaging** - determines how the lambda artifact is built. The easiest and most optimized way to build the lambda
  from Typescript/Javascript is using `stacktape-lambda-buildpack`. We only need to configure `entryfilePath`. Stacktape
  automatically transpiles and builds the application code with all of its dependencies, creates the lambda zip
  artifact, and uploads it to a pre-created S3 bucket on AWS. You can also use
  [other types of packaging](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/packaging/#packaging-lambda-functions).
- **ConnectTo list** - we are adding the mongo cluster `mongoDbCluster` into `connectTo` list. By doing this, Stacktape
  will automatically setup secure access to the cluster associated with the function's role as well as inject relevant
  environment variables into the function's runtime (such as connection string needed for connecting).
- **Events** - Events determine how is function triggered. In this case, we are triggering the function when an event
  (HTTP request) is delivered to the HTTP API gateway:

  - if URL path is `/posts` and HTTP method is `POST`, request is delivered to `savePost` function.
  - if URL path is `/posts` and HTTP method is `GET`, request is delivered to `getPosts` function.

  The event(request) including the request body is passed to the function handler as an argument.

```yml
savePost:
  type: function
  properties:
    packaging:
      type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
      properties:
        entryfilePath: ./src/lambdas/save-post.ts
    memory: 512
    connectTo:
      - mongoDbCluster
    events:
      - type: http-api-gateway
        properties:
          httpApiGatewayName: mainApiGateway
          path: /post
          method: POST

getPosts:
  type: function
  properties:
    packaging:
      type: stacktape-lambda-buildpack
      properties:
        entryfilePath: ./src/lambdas/get-posts.ts
    memory: 512
    connectTo:
      - mongoDbCluster
    events:
      - type: http-api-gateway
        properties:
          httpApiGatewayName: mainApiGateway
          path: /posts
          method: GET
```
