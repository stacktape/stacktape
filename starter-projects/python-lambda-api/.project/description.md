- simple Lambda-based HTTP API using Python runtime.
- The application runs in a [Lambda function](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/lambda-functions/) and uses
  [DynamoDb](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/dynamo-db-tables/) to store the data. To simplify
  the database access, this project uses [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
