- Server-side rendered [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) application deployed serverlessly.
- Uses the purpose-built [SvelteKit web resource](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/sveltekit-website/) that
  runs the app in AWS Lambda with static assets on CloudFront CDN. Zero infrastructure configuration needed.
