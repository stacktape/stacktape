- Server-side rendered [Astro](https://astro.build/) application deployed serverlessly.
- Uses the purpose-built [Astro web resource](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/astro-website/) that runs the
  app in AWS Lambda with static assets on CloudFront CDN. Zero infrastructure configuration needed.
