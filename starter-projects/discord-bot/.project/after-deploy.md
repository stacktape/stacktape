- Before deploying, create a bot at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Set the `discord-bot-token` secret to your bot token (or update the default in `stacktape.yml`).
- After deploying, invite the bot to your server using the OAuth2 URL from the Developer Portal (with `bot` and
  `applications.commands` scopes).
