# NuxtJs SSR website container

- This project deploys a simple Server-side rendered [NuxtJS v3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) application.
- The project uses a [Web Service](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/web-services/) to run the Nuxt app and a
  [S3 storage bucket](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/buckets/) with
  [CDN](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/cdns/) to host the static content.
- This project includes a pre-configured [stacktape.yml configuration](stacktape.yml).
  The configured infrastructure is described in the [stack description section](#stack-description)

## Pricing

- Fixed price resources:

  - **Web service** (~$0.012/hour, ~$9/month)

- There are also other resources that might incur costs (with pay-per-use pricing). If your load won't get high, these costs will be close to $0.

## 1. Generate your project

To initialize the project, use

```bash
stacktape init --projectId nuxtjs-ssr-website-container
```

To deploy your application inside [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) pipeline, also use the `--deployFrom codebuild` flag.

To deploy your application inside [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) pipeline, also use the `--deployFrom github` flag.

To deploy your application inside [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) pipeline, also use the `--deployFrom gitlab` flag.

## 2. Deploy your stack

The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

<details>
<summary>Deploy from local machine</summary>

<br />

The deployment from local machine will build and deploy the application from your system. This means you also need to have:

- Docker. To install Docker on your system, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).- Node.js installed.

<br />

To perform the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

<br />

| Region name & Location     | code           |

## 3. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the terminal (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

- Explore your application at **mainApiGateway -> url**. The URL was printed to the console.

## 4. Hotswap deploys

- Stacktape deployments use [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.

- To speed up the deployment, you can use the `--hotSwap` flag that avoids Cloudformation.
- Hotswap deployments work only for source code changes (for lambda function, containers and batch jobs) and for content uploads to buckets.
- If the update deployment is not hot-swappable, Stacktape will automatically fall back to using a Cloudformation deployment.

```bash
stacktape deploy --hotSwap --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

## 5. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stacktape delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
pipeline and other aspects of your stacks.

You can deploy your services to multiple environments (stages) - for
example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`. A stack is a running instance of a service. It consists of your application
code (if any) and the infrastructure resources required to run it.

The configuration for this service is described below.

## 1. Service name

You can choose an arbitrary name for your service. The name of the stack will be constructed as
`{service-name}-{stage}`.

```yml
serviceName: nuxtjs-ssr-website-container
```

## 2. Resources

- Every resource must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
- Stacktape resources consist of multiple (sometimes more than 15) underlying AWS or 3rd party resources.

### 2.1 Web Service

Application runs in web-service resource and is configured as follows:

- **Packaging** - determines how the Docker container image is built. The easiest and most optimized way to build the
  image for a Typescript application is using `stacktape-image-buildpack`. We only need to configure `entryfilePath`.
  Stacktape automatically transpiles and builds the application code with all of its dependencies, builds the Docker
  image, and pushes it to a pre-created image repository on AWS. You can also use
  [other types of packaging](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/packaging/#packaging-web-services).
- **Environment variables** - We are passing URL of the **static assets CDN** to the container as an environment
  variable. URL can be easily referenced using a
  [$ResourceParam() directive](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/directives/#resource-param). This directive
  accepts a resource name (`webBucket` in this case) and the name of the
  [bucket referenceable parameter](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/buckets/#referenceable-parameters) (`cdnUrl` in
  this case). If you want to learn more, refer to
  [referencing parameters](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/referencing-parameters/) guide and
  [directives](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/directives) guide.
- [Resources](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/web-services#resources). The cheapest available resource
  configuration is `0.25` of virtual CPU and `512` MB of RAM.
- For convenience, automatic CORS is enabled.

You can also configure [scaling](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/web-services#scaling). New (parallel)
container can be added when (for example) the utilization of your CPU or RAM gets larger than 80%. The traffic is evenly
distributed to all the containers.

```yml
resources:
  webService:
    type: web-service
    properties:
      packaging:
        type: stacktape-image-buildpack
        properties:
          entryfilePath: ./server.ts
      environment:
        - name: NUXT_APP_CDN_URL
          value: $ResourceParam('webBucket', 'cdnUrl')
      resources:
        cpu: 0.25
        memory: 512
      cors:
        enabled: true
```

### 2.2 Bucket

The bucket is used to store our static assets. By putting CDN in front of the bucket, its content can be distributed
across the globe and served with minimal latencies.

New/modified static assets are automatically uploaded during deployment process.

We are also enabling cors on our bucket, to allow clients(browsers) access to the resources.

```yml
webBucket:
  type: bucket
  properties:
    cors:
      enabled: true
    directoryUpload:
      directoryPath: ./.output/public
      headersPreset: static-website
    cdn:
      enabled: true
      invalidateAfterDeploy: true
```

## 3. Application build hook

To automatically build the application before each deployment, the stacktape configuration contains a
[script](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) and a
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

[Script](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) specifies the command to be executed. To execute it
automatically every time before the stack is deployed, we reference it inside a
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

```yml
scripts:
  nuxtBuild:
    executeCommand: npm run build

hooks:
  - triggers: ['before:deploy']
    scriptName: nuxtBuild
```

You can also execute the script manually anytime using `stp script:run`
[command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/script-run/).
