- simple Lambda-based HTTP API.
- The application runs in a [Lambda function](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/lambda-functions/) and uses
  [DynamoDb](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/dynamo-db-tables/) to store the data. To simplify the database access,
  this project uses [DynamoDb OneTable](https://github.com/sensedeep/dynamodb-onetable).
