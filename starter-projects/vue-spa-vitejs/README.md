# Vue SPA with Vite.js

- This project deploys a simple Single Page Application built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and
  [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).
- The project uses a [S3 storage bucket](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/buckets/) to store the application assets
  and a [CDN](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/cdns/) to cache the content at the edge.
- This project includes a pre-configured [stacktape.yml configuration](stacktape.yml).
  The configured infrastructure is described in the [stack description section](#stack-description)

## Pricing

- The infrastructure required for this application uses exclusively "serverless", pay-per-use infrastructure. If your load won't get high, these costs will be close to $0.

## Prerequisites

## 1. Generate your project

To initialize the project, use

```bash
stacktape init --projectId vue-spa-vitejs
```

To deploy your application inside [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) pipeline, also use the `--deployFrom codebuild` flag.

To deploy your application inside [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) pipeline, also use the `--deployFrom github` flag.

To deploy your application inside [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) pipeline, also use the `--deployFrom gitlab` flag.

## 2. Deploy your stack

The deployment will take ~5-15 minutes. Subsequent deploys will be significantly faster.

<details>
<summary>Deploy from local machine</summary>

<br />

The deployment from local machine will build and deploy the application from your system. This means you also need to have:

- Node.js installed.

<br />

To perform the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
stacktape deploy --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

`stage` is an arbitrary name of your environment (for example **staging**, **production** or **dev-john**)

`region` is the AWS region, where your stack will be deployed to. All the available regions are listed below.

<br />

| Region name & Location     | code           |
| -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Europe (Ireland)           | eu-west-1      |

## 3. Test your application

After a successful deployment, some information about the stack will be printed to the terminal (**URLs** of the deployed services, links to **logs**, **metrics**, etc.).

- Visit the CDN URL printed to the terminal.

## 4. Hotswap deploys

- Stacktape deployments use [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) under the hood. It
  brings a lot of guarantees and convenience, but can be slow for certain use-cases.

- To speed up the deployment, you can use the `--hotSwap` flag that avoids Cloudformation.
- Hotswap deployments work only for source code changes (for lambda function, containers and batch jobs) and for content uploads to buckets.
- If the update deployment is not hot-swappable, Stacktape will automatically fall back to using a Cloudformation deployment.

```bash
stacktape deploy --hotSwap --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

## 5. Delete your stack

- If you no longer want to use your stack, you can delete it.
- Stacktape will automatically delete every infrastructure resource and deployment artifact associated with your stack.

```bash
stacktape delete --stage <<stage>> --region <<region>>
```

# Stack description

Stacktape uses a simple `stacktape.yml` configuration file to describe infrastructure resources, packaging, deployment
pipeline and other aspects of your stacks.

You can deploy your services to multiple environments (stages) - for
example `production`, `staging` or `dev-john`. A stack is a running instance of a service. It consists of your application
code (if any) and the infrastructure resources required to run it.

The configuration for this service is described below.

## 1. Service name

You can choose an arbitrary name for your service. The name of the stack will be constructed as
`{service-name}-{stage}`.

```yml
serviceName: vue-spa-vitejs
```

## 2. Resources

- Every resource must have an arbitrary, alphanumeric name (A-z0-9).
- Stacktape resources consist of multiple (sometimes more than 15) underlying AWS or 3rd party resources.

### 2.1 Bucket

Bucket contains the built Vue Single-page application (SPA):

- The built app is automatically uploaded into the bucket as a part of the deployment process.
- [CDN](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/cdns/) is configured in front of the bucket to deliver your SPA across the
  world with minimal latency.
- To ensure that the CDN always serves the newest version of the app, CDN cache is automatically invalidated (flushed)
  after each deployment.

```yml
resources:
  webBucket:
    type: bucket
    properties:
      directoryUpload:
        directoryPath: ./dist
        headersPreset: single-page-app
      cdn:
        enabled: true
        rewriteRoutesForSinglePageApp: true
        invalidateAfterDeploy: true
```

## 3. Application build hook

To automatically build the application before each deployment, the stacktape configuration contains a
[script](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) and a
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

[Script](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/scripts/) specifies the command to be executed. To execute it
automatically every time before the stack is deployed, we reference it inside a
[hook](https://docs.stacktape.com/configuration/hooks/).

```yml
scripts:
  build:
    # or "yarn build"
    executeCommand: npm run build

hooks:
  - triggers: ['before:deploy', 'before:bucket:sync']
    scriptName: build
```

You can also execute the script manually anytime using `stp script:run`
[command](https://docs.stacktape.com/cli/commands/script-run/).
