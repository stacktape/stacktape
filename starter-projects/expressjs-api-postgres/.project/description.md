- simple HTTP API built using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
- The application runs in a [web service](https://docs.stacktape.com/compute-resources/web-services/) resource and uses
  a Postgres [relational database](https://docs.stacktape.com/resources/relational-databases/) to store the data. To
  simplify the database access, this project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).
